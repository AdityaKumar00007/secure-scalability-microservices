## Overview

Modern applications require scalable, resilient, and secure architectures to meet evolving user demands and mitigate cyber threats. This project focuses on crafting a robust microservices architecture and deploying it on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to ensure scalability and security. By integrating best practices in microservices design with Google Cloud's advanced security features, the project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for building and deploying resilient and secure applications.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Service A should handle user authentication.
- Service B should manage user profiles.
- Service C should handle data analytics.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability
- Resilience
- Security
- Performance Metrics

For detailed requirements analysis, refer to [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).

## Architecture

The microservices architecture consists of the following components:

- **Service A**: User Authentication
- **Service B**: User Profile
- **Service C**: Data Analytics

For API contracts and data models, refer to [docs/api-contracts.md](docs/api-contracts.md).

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-scalability-microservices.git
   cd secure-scalability-microservices
Deployment
The project is deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). For deployment instructions, refer to k8s/.

CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). For CI/CD pipeline configuration, refer to Jenkinsfile.

Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging are essential for tracking system performance and detecting anomalies. The project utilizes Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging. For monitoring and logging configuration, refer to k8s/monitoring-config.yaml.

Testing
Comprehensive testing is conducted to validate the scalability, resilience, and security of the microservices architecture. For testing scripts and scenarios, refer to tests/.

Documentation
Detailed documentation is provided in the docs/ directory, covering architecture, deployment steps, security measures, and CI/CD pipeline configuration.
